    "Depth-First Search, is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm used in computer science and graph theory. It is a way to explore and navigate graphs or trees systematically. Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking."

    "\n",
    "Exploring: In DFS, you begin at a source node and first explore as thoroughly as you can along one branch before turning around. By delving deeply into the network, stopping at nodes along the way, and repeatedly invoking itself to explore further levels, recursion naturally replicates this process.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Stack Memory Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion in DFS relies on the call stack to manage the nodes under exploration and their exploration status. The depth of this call stack mirrors the depth of the traversal within the graph. Here are several considerations regarding stack memory utilization in recursive DFS:\n",

    "Memory Efficiency: Recursive DFS is memory-efficient, particularly when dealing with sparse graphs or trees that have limited branching. It solely retains data for the ongoing branch being explored, which reduces memory overhead.\n",

    "Stack Depth: The maximum stack depth in recursive DFS is determined by the depth of the longest path in the graph. For graphs with extensive depths, employing recursive DFS might result in stack overflow errors. To mitigate this, one can opt for iterative DFS that employs an explicit stack data structure.\n",
    "\n",
