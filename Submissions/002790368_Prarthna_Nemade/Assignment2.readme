Assignment-2

In this assignment, I have covered topics such as,
1) Kruskal's Algorithm
2) DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
3) Prim's Algorithm
4) Master Theorem
5) Binary tree
6) Breadth-First-Search
7) Dijkstra's Algorithm

I tackled a wide range of algorithmic problems, each presenting its own set of complexities and requirements. 
These problems covered various areas, from optimizing routes for efficient navigation to detecting intricate patterns in sequences of events.
I found myself in situations where I had to categorize binary trees based on their balance and structure, and also come up with efficient ways to encode songs with repetitive patterns.

Furthermore, I worked on problems that involved sorting specialized graphs, navigating obstacles in grid-based environments, and finding paths in complex networks.
Comparing algorithms using masters's theorem.
These challenges really tested my problem-solving skills and helped me dive deeper into the principles of algorithm design. 
By working on these problems, I was able to improve my ability to come up with efficient and elegant solutions in the world of algorithms.
