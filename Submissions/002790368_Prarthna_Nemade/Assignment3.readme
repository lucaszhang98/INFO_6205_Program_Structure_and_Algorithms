Assignment 3:

Topics covered are:
Bellman-Ford algorithm
Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
Preflow-Push (Pushâ€“relabel) maximum flow algorithm
Master theorem
Dynamic programming
knapsack using dynmaic programming

I explored various algorithmic problems and discussed strategies to solve them, with a particular focus on dynamic programming as a key technique for optimizing solutions. I provided Python code snippets for each problem, demonstrating practical implementations of the discussed algorithms.
I also conducted a detailed analysis of the time complexity of algorithms, considering factors like subproblems and their computation times.
In cases where problems had a visual representation, I discussed graph plotting to enhance understanding.
I ensured that output explanations and verification were included to facilitate a clear understanding of code results.
Additionally, I emphasized the importance of problem design, encouraging the creation of engaging problems with unique aspects while aligning with classic problems like the knapsack problem.
