## The reflection of using ChatGPT

In this assignment, ChatGPT has demonstrated powerful problem-solving capabilities. However, an important point is that I need to clarify the problem description and requirements analysis first, so that it can effectively help me generate solutions. Therefore, we cannot solely rely on ChatGPT to solve problems; we need to analyze the problem clearly before posing questions to ChatGPT.
