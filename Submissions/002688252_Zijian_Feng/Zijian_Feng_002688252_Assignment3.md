## The reflection of using ChatGPT

In this assignment, ChatGPT has demonstrated powerful problem-solving capabilities.It was able to calculate the maximum flow on the fly. But like the dynamic programming problem, the answer he gave was not quite right. So we can rely on it to compute rather than analyze the problem.

## What I learned in this assignment

For this assignment, we reviewed dynamic programming problems as well as master theorem problems. For the dynamic programming problem, I did a more proficient job than before, and my planning for the state transfer equation was more reasonable. And for the maximum flow problem, I fully understood it after doing the homework.
