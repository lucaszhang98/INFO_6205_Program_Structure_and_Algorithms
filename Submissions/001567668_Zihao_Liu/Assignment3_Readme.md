## Assignment-3:

### How ChatGPT or the tool you used assisted in this task

Question 1, 2, 3 are regarding Bellman-Ford Algorithm. Theese questions help to understand Bellman-Ford algorithm and apply them to solve problems. Question 4, 5, 8 are regarding Network Flow. ChatGPT gives me a question regarding network flows and the Max Flow-Min Cut theorem. Question 6, 7 are regarding dynamic programming. ChatGPT provides detailed explanations and comparisons of complex concepts. For example, for question 8, it explains the Push-relabel algorithm in the context of the Ford-Fulkerson method, breaking down their methodologies, efficiencies, and complexities.

### Challenges you faced while ensuring the problem maintained the spirit of the example

ChatGPT often gives wrong graph representation. I asked multiple time to ChatGPT, then it acknowledged the mistake, illustrating the model's capacity for error correction and iterative refinement in response to user feedback. This adaptability is crucial in collaborative tasks, especially in problem design where precision and clarity are paramount.


### What you learned about problem design in the realm of algorithms
In algorithm-related problems, every detail can be crucial to the problem-solving process. Ensuring that the problem statement is clear and unambiguous is important. Some of the question that ChatGPT made is completly incorrect and giving an absolutely wrong response. Identifing this issue is also hard.
