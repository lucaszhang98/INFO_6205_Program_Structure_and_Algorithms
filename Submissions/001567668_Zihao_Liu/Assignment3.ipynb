    "The Ford-Fulkerson method focuses on increasing the flow in a network by finding augmenting paths from the source to the sink and increasing the flow along these paths until it's no longer possible. It uses residual graphs and capacities to find these paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Push-relabel algorithm, on the other hand, works by maintaining a \"preflow\" (where the flow might temporarily violate the conservation constraint) and repeatedly performs local, low-cost operations in the network to eventually achieve the maximum flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ford-Fulkerson method's time complexity can be quite high in worst-case scenarios, particularly when dealing with irrational flow values or large capacities, as the method heavily relies on finding suitable augmenting paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Push-relabel algorithm typically operates more efficiently, with a worst-case time complexity of $O(V^2 * E)$"
