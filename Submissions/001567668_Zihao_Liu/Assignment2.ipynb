    "**Problem Statement: Coin Change**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money `amount`. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Format:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- An array `coins` consisting of the different coin denominations. (`coins[i]` is a positive integer representing the `i`-th coin denomination)\n",
    "- An integer `amount` representing the total amount of money.\n",

    "  - `coins = [1, 2, 5]`\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Input:**\n",
    "  - `coins = [2]`\n",
    "  - `amount = 3`\n",

    "- **Input:**\n",
    "  - `coins = [1]`\n",
    "  - `amount = 0`\n",
    "- **Output:** `0`\n",
    "- **Explanation:** No coins are needed to get an amount of `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example 4:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:**\n",
    "  - `coins = [1]`\n",
    "  - `amount = 2`\n",
    "- **Output:** `2`\n",
    "- **Explanation:** `2 = 1 + 1`, so the output is `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- $1 \\leq \\text{len(coins)} \\leq 12$\n",
    "- $1 \\leq \\text{coins[i]} \\leq 2^{31} - 1$\n",
    "- $0 \\leq \\text{amount} \\leq 10^4$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "- You may assume that you have an infinite number of each of your coin denominations.\n",
    "- Think about the subproblems you need to solve.\n",
    "- Consider trying to find a relation between the solution for `amount` and solutions for smaller problems (like `amount - coins[i]` for all `i`).\n",
    "- Try to find a recurrence relation and then implement a bottom-up dynamic programming solution."
