## Assignment-2:

### How ChatGPT or the tool you used assisted in this task

Question 1, 2, 3 are regarding Heuristic Search and A*. ChatGPT gives me a Pac Man Project. It is the great example for the practice. Question 4, 5, 6 are regarding greedy algorithm. It is my first time trying to learn pseudocode. ChatGPT helped me to 
Question 7, 8, 9 are regarding dynamic programming. Climbing stair, coin change, and 0-1 Knapsack Problem.


### Challenges you faced while ensuring the problem maintained the spirit of the example
All questions is related to the topic we've covered from Assignment 1 to last Wednesday. I have done some graph problems on Assignment 1. This time I decide to practice more regarding terminology and coding questions. The questions are hard without support. Pseudocode is another different language as well. Again, not all questions are necessarily similar to the sample question. However, it is really helpful on learning those challenging topic.

### What you learned about problem design in the realm of algorithms
ChatGPT now is a good free "Leetcode" because it can generate a topic-specific coding question and gives a sample solution to check the answer. It is a good resource to use for supporting study.
