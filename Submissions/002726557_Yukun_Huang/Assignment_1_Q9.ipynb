    "Q1. Arrange the following functions in increasing order of growth:\n",
    "1.\tlog(n2)\n",

    "7.\t10n\n",
    "8.\tlog(n3)\n",
    "9.\tn1/3\n",
    "10.\t n! * 2n\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "1.\tlog(n2) is a logarithmic function. The exponent 2 in log(n2) doesn't affect the order of growth, so it's Θ(log(n)).\n",
    "2.\t2(2n) is an exponential function and it's Θ(2n).\n",
    "3.\t3n3 + 2n2 is a polynomial function. It has the exponent (n3), so it's Θ(n3).\n",
    "4.\tn4 is also a polynomial function, and it's Θ(n4).\n",
    "5.\tsqrt(n) + log(n) combines a square root term and a logarithmic term. Both terms grow slower than the polynomial terms, so this function grows slower than any polynomial but faster than logarithmic or constant terms. So, it's Θ(sqrt(n)).\n",
    "6.\tn2 + n is a polynomial function with an exponent of n2, which falls between n3 and n4 in terms of growth. So, it's Θ(n2).\n",
    "7.\t10n is another exponential function, and it grows extremely fast. It's Θ(10n).\n",
    "8.\tlog(n3) is a logarithmic function. The exponent 3 in log(n^3) doesn't affect the order of growth, so it's still Θ(log(n)).\n",
    "9.\tn1/3 is a polynomial function with an exponent of 1/3. It grows slower than n2 but faster than linear functions, so it's Θ(n1/3).\n",
    "10.\t n! * 2n involves a factorial and an exponential term. Factorials grow extremely fast, but exponentials grow even faster. So, this function grows faster than any of the previous functions and is Θ (n! * 2n).\n",

    "Q3. Following a catastrophic natural disaster, multiple disaster-stricken locations require assistance from various relief organizations. Unfortunately, there is often a disconnect between the available resources and the needs of these locations. Your task is to develop an algorithm to efficiently allocate relief resources to different disaster-stricken areas, considering the preferences of both the relief organizations and the affected locations.\n",
    "Here's what you have:\n",
    "•\tA list of disaster-stricken areas, each with a unique number.\n",
    "•\tFor each area, you know how much of each resource it needs, like food, water, medical supplies, and shelter.\n",
    "•\tA group of volunteers, each with their own preferences for the areas based on expertise and resource availability. Higher values mean stronger preferences.\n",
    "•\tConstraints that specify the minimum and maximum amount of each resource type that can be allocated to each area.\n",
    "Your goal is to create an allocation plan that satisfies the following conditions:\n",
    "•\tEach disaster-stricken location must receive a specific amount of each resource type within the specified constraints.\n",
    "•\tThe allocation plan must be stable, meaning that no relief organization and location would prefer each other over their current allocations.\n",
    "•\tRelief organizations must be allocated to locations in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction. The satisfaction of a relief organization with a location is the sum of their preferences for that location's expertise and available resources.\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "1.\tWhile there are unassigned volunteers:\n",
    "•\tPick the next unassigned volunteer (v1).\n",
    "•\tFor v1, find the area (a1) that maximizes their preference score, considering expertise and available resources.\n",

    "Q4. One algorithm requires n2 + 10n microseconds and another algorithm requires 2n microseconds. Which one is asymptotically faster? What is the cross-over value of n?\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "As n approaches infinity, the exponential growth of Algorithm (2n) significantly outpaces the polynomial growth of Algorithm (n2 + 10n). Therefore, Algorithm (n2 + 10n) is asymptotically faster than Algorithm (2n). Crossover point of n is 7.\n",

    "Q5. You are tasked with building a wall using a grid of rectangular bricks, following a specific pattern. Each row of the wall must have several bricks equal to the sum of the number of bricks in the previous two rows. Additionally, you need to ensure that the total number of bricks used in the wall does not exceed a certain limit, denoted by 'n'. Your goal is to find the most efficient way to construct the wall while minimizing the total number of bricks used.\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "Utilize a Fibonacci-like sequence, starting with two initial rows of one brick each (1 and 1). Each subsequent row follows the Fibonacci pattern.\n",
    "R is the largest Fibonacci number less than n.\n",
    "The minimum number of bricks required m is equal to the (R+2) th Fibonacci number.\n",

    "Solution:\n",
    "Algorithm B, which requires n3 seconds, grows asymptotically faster than Algorithm A, which requires 2n seconds.\n",

    "Q7. In a stable matching problem, consider a scenario involving a group of students and a group of universities. Each student has a preference list of universities, and each university has a preference list of students. A stable matching is one where there are no pairs of students and universities who prefer each other over their current assignments.\n",
    "Now, suppose there exists a student named Alice and a university named XYZ such that Alice is ranked first on the preference list of XYZ, and XYZ is ranked first on Alice's preference list. These rankings imply that both Alice and XYZ would ideally want to be matched with each other.\n",
    "Question: Is it always true that in every stable matching for this scenario, the pair (Alice, XYZ) belongs to the matching?\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "The statement is True. In every stable matching for this scenario, the pair (Alice, XYZ) will always belong to the matching.\n",
    "Alice is ranked first on the preference list of university XYZ and Alice has university XYZ as her top choice, they will choose each than others. If Alice and university XYZ are not matched with each other in a stable matching, it would imply that there is another student and university pair (For example, Bob and UVW) such that both Bob and UVW prefer each other over their current assignments. However, this would contradict the stability of the matching, as Alice and XYZ would both prefer each other and would prefer to be matched with each other, making the matching unstable.\n",
    "Therefore, in any stable matching, the pair (Alice, XYZ) must be included because it is the most preferred choice for both Alice and university XYZ.\n",

    "Q8. Suppose we have two basketball teams, Team A and Team B. Each basketball team has a set of players, and each player has their own position on the basketball court. Let's assume the players are denoted as Player P and their respective positions as Position Q. Note that each player can have different positions on the court except for the Center position (C). Each team wants to win the championship, and to do so, they need to devise a strategy that assigns each player to a distinct best position on the court, allowing each player to perform to their fullest strengths. The performance of the team is judged solely based on the player's performance in the team, and there are no other criteria to evaluate the team's performance except for individual player performance.\n",
    "One way to determine how well the two teams will perform against each other is by evaluating their strategies. Each player has a fixed rating based on their performance in the current season, and no two players share the same rating. The team wins a game if it has a higher-rated player assigned to a particular position than the player assigned by the opposing team. For example, if Team A assigns a player P to Position Q with a rating of 90, then Team B can win the game only if it has a player with a higher rating than 90 assigned to that same position.\n",
    "The goal of each team is to win as many games as possible to achieve the championship. In the opening week of the basketball season, Team A reveals a strategy S, and Team B reveals a strategy T. Based on this pair of strategies, each team wins certain games, following the rule mentioned above. We'll say that the pair of strategies (S, T) is stable if neither Team A nor Team B can unilaterally change its own strategy and win more games. In other words, there is no strategy S' that Team A can adopt to win more games with the pair (S', T), and symmetrically, there is no strategy T' that Team B can adopt to win more games with the pair (S, T') than it did with the original pair (S, T).\n",
    "For any set of players and their ratings associated with particular positions they play, is there always a stable pair of strategies? Provide either an algorithm that can find a stable pair of strategies or an example of a set of players and associated ratings for positions where no stable pair of strategies exists.\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "There is not always a stable pair of strategy.\n",
    "Team A has two players, {A1, A2}, with ratings 90 and 80 for specific positions on the basketball court.\n",
    "Team B has two players, {B1, B2}, with ratings 85 and 95 for the same positions.\n",
    "If Team A pairs A1 against B1, Team B can switch its strategy to pair B1 against A2, where B1 has a higher rating than A2. Then team B win.\n",
    "If Team A pairs A1 against B2, Team A can switch its strategy to pair A1 against B1, where A1 has a higher rating than B1. Then team A win.\n",
    "In either case, one team can unilaterally change its strategy to win more matches.\n",

    "Q9. The NBA is changing its playoff format using the Gale-Shapley matching algorithm. Rather than Western Conference teams playing Western Conference teams; the eight Western Conference teams will be matched against the eight Eastern Conference teams using the Gale-Shapley matching algorithm. Further social media will be used to ask fans, media, players and coaches to create a ranking of which teams they most like to face.\n",
    "C. Solution:\n",
    "\tThe Gale-Shapley algorithm is used to create a single round of stable matching. Applying it repeatedly in each round does not guarantee overall stability over multiple rounds.\n",
    "\tTeam and individual (fans, media, players and coaches) preferences can change from round to round. This means that a match that may be stable in one round may be unstable in the next round.\n",
    "D. Solution:\n",
    "The Gale-Shapley matching algorithm is designed to create stable matches in a scenario where two sets of agents with preferences are trying to be matched. In the context of the NBA playoff format change, where teams are ranked by fans, media, players, and coaches, the Gale-Shapley algorithm could still be used to create stable matches.\n",
    "while the Gale-Shapley algorithm can still create stable matches in this context, the definition of \"stability\" may be more subjective and related to fan and team preferences rather than the mathematical stability of the algorithm itself.\n"

    "1. Assistance from ChatGPT: ChatGPT was instrumental in providing guidance and code examples for simulating and measuring the execution time of the Gale-Shapley matching algorithm with changing list sizes. It offered a structured approach to tackling the problem and shared knowledge about the algorithm and timing functions. This guidance significantly expedited the problem-solving process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Challenges in Maintaining the Problem's Spirit: The primary challenge was to adapt the problem to measure execution time as the list sizes doubled while avoiding unnecessary shuffling of preference lists. The initial code had a redundant shuffling process that affected the accuracy of execution time measurement. Removing this and ensuring stable matching without unnecessary iterations required careful modification of the code structure. Additionally, displaying execution times that were not rounded to zero for small list sizes presented a challenge, which was resolved by using `time.perf_counter()` and formatting the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Learning about Problem Design: This exercise highlighted the importance of efficient algorithm design and the need to balance realism with practicality in simulations. It taught me that sometimes, real-world constraints and requirements may necessitate modifications to algorithms to make them feasible. It also underscored the significance of precise timing when measuring algorithm performance and the importance of choosing appropriate timing functions for the task.\n"
