    "This code finds the minimum spanning tree of a graph by using Kruskal's algorithm. It prints the edges in the minimum spanning tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof of correctness:** Kruskal's algorithm involves demonstrating that the algorithm indeed produces a minimum spanning tree (MST) of a connected, weighted graph. The correctness of the algorithm can be established by two main properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Kruskal's Algorithm Always Produces a Spanning Tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is relatively straightforward to prove. The algorithm starts with an empty set and iteratively adds edges from the sorted list of edges that do not create cycles in the current set of chosen edges. Since the graph is assumed to be connected, it is guaranteed that Kruskal's algorithm will always produce a spanning tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Kruskal's Algorithm Produces a Minimum Spanning Tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove this property, we need to show that the spanning tree produced by Kruskal's algorithm has the minimum possible total weight among all possible spanning trees of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the Cut Property to prove this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cut Property: For any cut C of the graph, if the weight of an edge e is the minimum among all edges crossing the cut C, then e must belong to every minimum spanning tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's prove that Kruskal's algorithm satisfies the Cut Property:\n",
    "\n",
    "Kruskal's algorithm adds edges to the MST in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n",
    "For a particular cut C, when the algorithm considers adding an edge e, it chooses the edge with the minimum weight that does not create a cycle.\n",
    "If there are multiple edges with the same minimum weight, it chooses any of them.\n",
    "Now, let's consider the situation where Kruskal's algorithm considers an edge e for inclusion in the MST, and there is another minimum weight edge e' that crosses the same cut C. The algorithm could choose e' instead of e. However, this would not affect the minimality of the MST, as both e and e' have the same minimum weight and satisfy the Cut Property.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the MST produced by Kruskal's algorithm is a valid spanning tree, and it is guaranteed to have the minimum possible weight among all possible spanning trees because it adds edges in non-decreasing order of their weights, and each edge added satisfies the Cut Property.\n",

    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts by choosing a vertex with no incoming edges. In a DAG, such a vertex always exists, as there are no cycles, and therefore, there must be at least one vertex with an in-degree of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm proceeds by visiting the chosen vertex, marking it as visited, and decrementing the in-degrees of its neighbors. This step ensures that any vertex with an in-degree of 0 is always visited and added to the topological order.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the nature of the algorithm, each vertex is visited only once. This is because once a vertex is marked as visited and its in-degree is decremented, it will not be considered as a candidate again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm continues to select vertices with in-degrees of 0 as candidates for the next step. This guarantees that vertices with dependencies on other vertices are considered only after their dependencies are included in the topological order.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the graph is truly a DAG, the algorithm will visit and add all vertices to the topological order. This is because, in a DAG, there is always a valid topological order.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the graph contains cycles, the algorithm may not be able to visit all vertices, and some will remain unprocessed. In this case, it is impossible to generate a topological order since the presence of a cycle indicates a circular dependency that cannot be resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the algorithm ensures that vertices are added to the topological order in such a way that all dependencies are satisfied, and it terminates correctly. The proof relies on the principles of DAGs and the algorithm's design. If the graph is not a DAG (i.e., contains cycles), the algorithm will not produce a valid topological order, but that's a property of the input data rather than a failure of the algorithm.\n",

    "The correctness of the algorithm for determining whether a specific order pattern (sequence) is a subsequence of a customer's order history can be proven by demonstrating that it satisfies both the base case and the inductive step.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the base case, when either the order history or the intended order is empty (i.e., either n or m is equal to zero), the algorithm correctly returns whether the empty sequence is a subsequence of the other sequence. Since an empty sequence is trivially a subsequence of any sequence, the base case is satisfied.\n",

    "\n",
    "We want to prove that if the algorithm correctly determines whether an intended order sequence of length (m+1) is a subsequence of an order history sequence of length (n+1), it also correctly determines whether an intended order sequence of length m is a subsequence of an order history sequence of length n.\n",

    "To do this, consider an order history of length (n+1) and an intended order of length (m+1). The algorithm iterates through both sequences simultaneously, and if the matching product or category is found, it advances in the order history and intended order.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the inductive hypothesis, the algorithm correctly determines whether the intended order sequence of length m is a subsequence of the order history sequence of length n. Adding one more item to both sequences does not change this correctness, as the algorithm continues to check for matches and advances accordingly. If the entire intended order is traversed, it's considered a subsequence of the order history.\n",

    "Therefore, the inductive step ensures that the algorithm correctly determines whether an intended order sequence is a subsequence of an order history sequence, and the base case handles the trivial cases, proving the correctness of the algorithm.\n",

    "The correctness of Prim's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree (MST) can be proven using the following principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Greedy Choice Property:** Prim's algorithm is based on the Greedy Choice Property, which means it selects the minimum-weight edge that connects a vertex from the current MST to a vertex outside the MST at each step. We assume that this choice is always correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cut Property:** The Cut Property states that if you have any cut (partition) of the graph, the minimum-weight edge crossing that cut is always part of the MST. This property ensures that the edges selected by Prim's algorithm form a minimum spanning tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's provide a high-level proof of correctness:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base Case:**\n",
    "Initially, the minimum spanning tree is empty, and any vertex can serve as the start. We select a start vertex and add it to the MST. This trivially forms a minimum spanning tree because it's a single vertex with no edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inductive Step:**\n",
    "We prove that if the algorithm has selected k edges and vertices, these edges form a minimum spanning tree. When the (k+1)-th edge is added, it is also part of the minimum spanning tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the edges selected by the algorithm so far (k edges) form a minimum spanning tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider the (k+1)-th edge. It's the minimum-weight edge that connects a vertex inside the current MST to a vertex outside the MST. Due to the Cut Property, this edge must be part of the minimum spanning tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "By induction, the algorithm successfully forms a minimum spanning tree when all edges are selected, as every edge selected during the process is part of the minimum spanning tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm terminates when all vertices are included in the MST. Thus, the result is indeed a minimum spanning tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Prim's algorithm is based on the Greedy Choice and Cut Properties, and through induction, it's proven to correctly identify a minimum spanning tree in a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reflection Quality:** \n",
    "Key learnings from solving the problem with Prim's algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree:\n",

    "1. Greedy Approach: Prim's algorithm employs a greedy strategy by selecting the minimum-weight edges, which is a common technique for solving optimization problems.\n",

    "2. Minimum Spanning Tree: Understanding the concept of minimum spanning trees is crucial, as it has practical applications in network design, routing, and infrastructure planning.\n",
