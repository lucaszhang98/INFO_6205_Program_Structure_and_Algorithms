Using ChatGPT and based on the worked examples provided, I have tried to create new algorithemic problems, and
throghout the assignment, I have provided algorithemic problems, clear and well-structured solutions, pseduocode and codes,
code. offered logical explanations, visualization of graphs, and demonstrated a solid grasp of algorithmic concepts.
These solutions and explanations can be a valuable resource for others studying algorithms.

Concepts included:
-Bellman-Ford algorithm
-Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
-Kruskal's algorithm
-DFS
-Dynamic programming
-Directed graph and adjacency
-Master Theorem
-Visualization of graphs etc.
