Assignment-2 summary

This assignment helped me understand the intricasies of using generative AI. ChatGPT got many more questions wrong that I was expecting, especially in topics such as master theorum, where it kept giving me wrong answers to Case 2 type solutions. In addition, a lot of graph questions generated by ChatGPT were unclear because it would draw the graphs using ascii characters which didn't line up correctly, causing confusion on what the input data was. It did not give multiple forms of input data most of the time, essentially rendering the questions unsolvable due to ambiguity. 
In addition, I learned a lot about the implementation of graphs in programming as I was using python objects to store and maintain graphs. This also taught me about objects and structs in python which I didn't know earlier. 
The dynamic programming implementation was helpful in giving me experience with recursive functions, and I spent a lot of time fixing and understanding array indexing and recursion base cases in dynamic programming.
