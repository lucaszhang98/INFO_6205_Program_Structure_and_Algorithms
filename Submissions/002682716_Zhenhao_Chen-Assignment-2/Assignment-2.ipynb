    "I used ChatGPT to assist me in this task. It's really a cool tool for us to create something and learn something. When I have confusion about the sample questions, ChatGPT could provide me with explanations. Especially when it comes to MST problems, ChatGPT could always some creative problems. All the problems it generated for me can greatly enhance my understanding to these algorithms.\n",

    "Challenges you faced while ensuring the problem maintained the spirit of the example:\n",
    "It's a little difficult when it comes to the MST or shortest-path problems cause I was so unfamiliar with graph. But after going through the sample problems, it just became more clear that how these algorithm works. And that's why I can clarify it's Kruskal's algorithm problem or some other algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you learned about problem design in the realm of algorithms:\n",
    "- The most important thing that I've learned is that a well-designed algorithmic problem is clear and precisely defined. Ambiguity can lead to confusion and difficulties in understanding the problem's requirements. Therefore, it's of great essential to provide a clear and unambiguous problem statement.\n",
    "- Moreover, it's also helpful to provide clear sample input and output since they clarify the problem's requirements.\n",
    "- Those problems about graph or dynamic programming should be practical."
