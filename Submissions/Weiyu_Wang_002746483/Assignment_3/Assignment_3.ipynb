    "# If the maximum flow equals the total number of shelters (n), and each distribution point receives at most [n/m] shelters, \n",
    "# then a valid connection scheme exists. Otherwise, it's not possible.\n",

    "# Time Complexity:\n",
    "# The time complexity of the Max Flow algorithm, such as the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, is O(E * f), \n",
